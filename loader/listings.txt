The relationship of the price to income is called cap rate. If the income remains the same, the more I have to pay for the prop, the lower my return. The LOWER the cap the HIGHER the price. When first listed the cap was slightly under the sold comp cap rates, which meant it was slightly higher priced than the comps. The average sold cap rate since July '14 is 4.28% down from 5.67%. The average asking cap rate is 3.71%. This  property is listed with a 5.41% cap. What does that mean? The income is better than any of the sold units since July and way better than anything else that is offered currently. Is it better to get a 5.41% return or a 3.71% return? Of course the higher amount. The cap is calculated by dividing the net income by the price. If I want to know the value of a cash flow at a given interest rate I simply divide Net Income by the cap. Taking this properties NOI of $39,475 divided by the average sold cap of 4.28% would yield a $922,313 price for this property. In other words the income this property generates is equal to a sold property generating the same income but a sale price of $922,313 and an active property at $1,064,016. MOST NET INCOME for anything offered now or sold since July.

The property is comprised of ground floor retail space along with two office/residential units on the second floor.  The 5,620 SF property is situated on a 4,996 SF lot zoned Commercial Limited(CL). The zoning allows a variety of uses including office, retail, and residential. There is a two car garage along with a small open lot for parking behind the property with alley access.  The creative office on the second floor is ready for immediate occupancy. The 2,135 SF space features 3 offices, bullpen, reception, kitchen, break room, two bathrooms (one w/tub and shower) and outdoor patio space. The office is ideal for tech, post-production, artist studio, ad agency, casting, creative and general office use.  It was previously used as a three bedroom two bath apartment. There is a second smaller office/studio apartment on the second floor as well with a month to month tenant.  The second floor office/residential units can be leased at market rent providing substantial upside for an investor.  On the other hand an owner/user can occupy one or both of the spaces while offsetting operating costs with income from the retail space below.

Wow! appreciate the fabulous OPPORTUNITY that a partnership dissolving now bring to YOU! Sellers reluctantly must sell as they need to liquidate all their properties, there are others, some listed on MLS and others not as yet listed and Carry Back loans available on those too! This tri-plex represents tremendous value in San Jacinto which city has a very lucrative rental market, and each unit has it's own garage and an additional driveway space to park another car. The property shares a courtyard with another triplex, it is well situated near downtown San Jacinto and so although the sellers have enjoyed the nice dividends this GEM pays out, year after year after year, the partnership must dissolve.  Solid, steady on time rental income is what the history of this property offers and so make an offer and start collecting dividends which will enrich you, your business and your loved one's for many years to come. Remember willing to do a Carry Back for you, also for other properties they have on MLS. Once you run the numbers you will wonder, "Why even sell them?". The answer is, partnership is dissolving and so NOW is YOUR OPPORTUNITY!

Two 2 car tandem garages and a 1 car garage with storage room. Condo convertable! This buidling is in great condition and seller is motivated! Rent shown is actual with room to raise! Currently none of the garages are being used by tenants and are not rented. Garages are used as storage by owner. Each garage approximate rent is about $250. 1 car garage with storage unit was also a tandem but a wall was built to separate storage from garage.  GSI is at $71,676 but at market price and with garages rented you're looking at $80,676 for a multiplier of 12.33x gross.

Zoned R3 in a "medium density" area according to the City of Loma Linda website.  Fabulous views and walking distance to LLUMC and the Veteran's Hospital.  This home could continue to generate income while planning is done on developing the 3 parcels.  All 3 parcels to be sold together.

The property has been in the same family since it was constructed in 1952, and this is the first time it has ever been offered for sale.  The property provides an excellent opportunity for a risk-averse investor to acquire a commercial asset featuring strong cash flow and historically low vacancy rates in a prime infill Los Angeles County market, and also enjoy immediate upside as all the leases are significantly below market and on month-to-month to annual terms.   RESIDENTIAL UNITS (2nd Floor – 4 units) The residential unit mix on the second floor includes a large one (1) x two (2) bedroom/one (1) bathroom + den (2b+1b+den), and three (3) one (1) bedroom/one (1) bathroom units (1b+1b). Each unit is separately metered for electricity and gas, and includes laundry hookups and an individual water heater.

We are please to present this unique Burbank property with multiple uses. Close to all the studios, the front house of this R-2 property has 2 bedrooms, 1 bath, a laundry room and 2 bonus rooms.  The back "unit" has not been permitted as a separate unit.  It consists currently of a permitted very large "game room" and a study with a 3/4 bath.  Could be converted to a separate unit. There is ample parking for 2 units.  The two units are attached by a single doorway that could be blocked off.  This property is located on an alley which allows easy access to the amazing oversized garage that the city calls a 4 car garage but it is much larger.  It would easily accommodate a 45 ft motorhome and other vehicles.   There is a mezzanine in the garage-accessed by a staircase that is approximately 750 sq.ft. Perfect for storage.  All garage improvements and study and game room were permitted in 1991.  At the side of the garage is a large cement pad for more cars or a boat.  Perfect for someone with large equipment. It was previously used by someone from the studios. Please view all the photos to see this amazing property.  Garage/workshop area could be rented separately from house. Must see to appreciate.

Across PCH from the expansive beaches of Newport. All units are full-sized one bedroom, one bath units; some upstairs units have ocean views with large balconies and others with canal views. One of the units has a nice sized den as well which could be a smaller 2nd bedroom. This property is adjacent to the desirable residential community of Newport Shores and encircled by a canal. The Newport Shores Apartments are just a few hundred yards from the beach and as such, there is strong rental demand.  This is one of the few buildings exceeding 2-4 units in the immediate West Newport Beach and peninsula area.   Recent select rent increases 30+%.Rents are very, very low with an immediate attainable upside of almost 20% due to out of area ownership. The property features a private pool, 3 enclosed garages and 10 covered spaces.  Many of the interiors have been upgraded and show well. Analysis is market data. Current GSI: $173,640, actual NOI is $99,342. Because rents are way under market the new LTV will be under 50%.

The subject property is composed of two detached single family homes on an 8,640-square foot (approx) lot.  The front house is a 696 sqft one bedroom/one bath home with a detached one car garage.  The rear house is a 869 sqft two bedroom/one bath home with an attached two car garage.  The owner pays for water and landscaping and the tenants pay for gas, electric and trash.  Both of the tenants have lived in these homes now for over ten years.  The zoning on this property is R-3 which would allow for a possible exit strategy at some point which would entail re-entitling the parcel for 4-5 new townhomes.

Great open space for tenants.  7 of the 8 units have had complete updates including stacked washer/dryer units in each unit.  4 garages and 1 open parking space in the rear off the alley.  Units are 1 bedroom and have retained most of the charm of this era property.  Rents are probably low because the units rented before the work was completed.  The 1 unit that hasn't been upgraded is in good condition, the existing tenant wanted to stay so the seller chose to not do that unit.

Mixed use zoned income property that will qualify for a standard residential loan!  This property is currently owner occupied and the front unit is partially being used for a commercial Bail Bonds business, but can be easily converted back to full residential use.  Owner will consider any reasonable offer to purchase the business opportunity along with the property.  There are 3- 3+2 and 1- 2+1, all units are 2 story townhome style units with open gated parking in the rear.  Each unit has been upgraded and each unit is occupied and move-in ready.  The owner occupied unit in the rear (7716) has been completely remodeled and has superior upgrades (see photos).  Currently the owner has a government contract "at-will" for transitional housing and is receiving $6,125 in rent for 2 units.  The other 2 units are for owner's living and business, thus presenting the potential for an additional $3,400 in rent from traditional tenants or the possibility of $6,000 in transitional housing income.  The income potential for this property is abundant.  This is a very unique opportunity that you do not want to miss out on!

The unit mix consists of 19 studio / one-bath and two one-bed / one-bath units. The property was constructed in 1929 of wood-frame and stucco.  The subject property is approximately one mile from the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports and is centrally located between the 710 Long Beach and 110 Harbor freeways. Because of its convenient location to local commerce and the limited supply of apartment buildings in the immediate area, the subject property’s units are in very high demand. This is a great opportunity for an investor looking to acquire a cash flowing property with rental upside in a high demand location.

Could be a great second home or primary residence as well. Tenants have the use of a coin-op Laundry room, and garden area along side each level. The view will not be disturbed since the waterfront lot across the street is not buildable (owned by water company). The separate lot - two parcels down from the house, "WATERFRONT" with Fisherman's shack and Boardwalk is also available!!  The seller would like to sell as a bundle - so include the other parcel 037-232-0500 - 12441 Lakeshore Dr in your offer and add the waterfront lot at additional price of $75,000! The waterfront parcel is fenced, and has a launch ramp along side... The combo would be a GREAT PRICE! for all of this at once!! The seller will not sell the waterfront parcel prior to the sale of the residence.

Currently, each unit is 770 square feet, and has one very large bedroom, a living area, functional kitchen and bathroom. Sitting on a nearly 6000 square foot lot, this property offers an over sized front yard and a very spacious and private side yard off one of the units.

Only minutes away from the back bay trails, neighborhood parks, great schools, the shopping, restaurants and entertainment of Triangle Square and a short distance to the beach.

Circa 1890 large Victorian or Queen Anne style home.  It is on the historical register for its architecture.  This is a three-story house, complete with attic and basement, with approximately 2700 sq. ft.  The house built for the Hewitt family - a prominent Santa Ana family - thus it is registered as the Hewitt House.  At one time the house was divided into 2 residences, but was restored to a single family home a number of years ago.  Additionally, in 1959 a legal 4 plex was constructed in the rear of the property over a two 2 car garage (total 4 parking spaces). In recent times, with a permit, the 4 units were consolidated into 2 larger units, with a downstairs unit which is available for storage.  There are lots of possibilities for this property.  The units produce a modest income of $3800 per month and a conservative projection estimate would place the income at around $5000 per month.  Property has been placed in reasonably good functional condition by the last two owners.  This to be verified by the Buyer of course.  Existing tenants have been there 10 and 17 years which partially explains the low rent.

The wood frame, painted stucco building offers 8371 rentable square feet and was constructed in 1987.  The property offers 17 ground level parking spaces thus making it a prime property for a future condo conversion.

Just 100 feet to the beach, this incredible ocean view property sits on one of the most coveted corner lots in the Manhattan Beach Sand Section and offers you the rare opportunity to build, live or rent. Perhaps this is where you’ll create your ultimate California beach retreat, and enjoy a lifetime of fresh ocean breezes, long strolls on the Strand, quick afternoon swims, unbelievable sunsets, and daily walks to the award-winning restaurants and charming boutiques of downtown MB. Or perhaps you’ll keep the well-maintained property as-is and with its investment income that the 6-unit long-term or vacation rental building is sure to bring. Completely refurbished in the last few years, the five 1-bedroom units plus studio apartment boast stylish, high-quality touches including travertine floors, recessed lighting, stainless appliances, and sparkling modern bathrooms with custom tile-work and frameless shower doors. Four garages - washer and dryer hookups in 2 garages are an added bonus—but the real selling point here is the location. Everyone wants to live here, in the heart of the California dream!

The property is one block South of South Street and two blocks East of Long Beach Blvd. in a low density pocket of mostly single family residential homes in the city of Long Beach. Built in 1972, the wood frame, painted stucco building offers 6761 rentable square feet and is situated on a 19,942 square foot lot. The property incorporates three separate apartment buildings and offers a unit mix of 2 one bedroom/one bathroom, and 7 two bedroom/one bathroom units.

It's not a duplex but in 1996 2 beautiful homes were built on one corner lot. One faces South O Street and the other faces W 6th. Both are identical homes with 3 spacious bedrooms and 2 baths, 2 car garage with inside laundry room and dual pane windows throughout. New laminate floors and carpets were placed about a year ago. You get the privacy in each of these homes with a fenced backyard to entertain family and friends. These homes are very well kept up inside and out. Don't miss out on owning 2 homes on one lot with the potential of living in one while renting the other. Needs to be sold jointly.

There is a separate laundry for the use of all units and there are three carports. The potential here is tremendous.  All units are fully furnished including big screen tv's and are used as summer/winter rentals. The owner will help with training  the buyer and showing how he has done it for years. There is upside potential for rents.  The highest gross and lowest rent multiplier on the peninsula for a building like this makes it a spectacular investment.

It is perfect for an owner occupant who wants to live near the beach and take advantage of rental income to offset their mortgage or for an investor looking for a true pride of ownership property for their portfolio.  The front building consists of a one bedroom one bath downstairs and a two bedroom one bath upstairs along with a private yard for the tenants.  Both units have had some updating and the upper unit has hardwood floors, a remodeled bathroom and a remodeled kitchen with granite counters.  There is a new roof and two garages.  The two units in the back feel more like individual houses.  A private fenced yard fronts the first one which is a well laid out one bedroom one bath tastefully remodeled with granite counters, an updated bathroom and refinished hardwood floors.  The one bedroom at the back also has a great layout, remodeled kitchen, new tile shower, a stackable washer/dryer and a private garage.  In addition to the three garages there is plenty of onsite parking for the tenants.  The current owner has kept rents below market – this is a great time to get in the game with an ideally located property with tons of upside!
